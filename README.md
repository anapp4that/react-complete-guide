Following the React Complete Guide from Udemy 

This contains all work from the first 4 sections, after that sections are split into branches
and commits are made on every subsection that I think is worth enought to commit

This course may appear to have commits from two different people.
Both commiters are me, one Identity is my personal account, and the other
comes from my work account. 

I started logging my code in git during section 5 of this course. After that I branched on new sections, and commited when I made minor changes during the lectures
